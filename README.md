# üéâ My First Python Program: Hello World & Arithmetic Operations üéâ

Welcome to my first Python program! In this project, I‚Äôve created a simple Python script that:
- Prints the classic "Hello, World!" message
- Performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division)

Feel free to explore the code, and see how Python can be used for basic tasks and calculations.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Hello World !**: The program prints "Hello, World!" to get started with Python.
- **Arithmetic Operations**: It performs fundamental arithmetic operations:
  - **Addition** ‚ûï
  - **Subtraction** ‚ûñ
  - **Multiplication** ‚úñÔ∏è
  - **Division** ‚ûó

## üìù Code Overview

Here‚Äôs a look at the program that does all the magic:

```python
# Hello World and Arithmetic Operations in Python

# Printing Hello World
print("Hello, World!")

# Defining variables
a = 10
b = 5

# Addition
addition = a + b
print(f"Addition of {a} and {b} is {addition}")

# Subtraction
subtraction = a - b
print(f"Subtraction of {a} and {b} is {subtraction}")

# Multiplication
multiplication = a * b
print(f"Multiplication of {a} and {b} is {multiplication}")

# Division
division = a / b
print(f"Division of {a} and {b} is {division}")
